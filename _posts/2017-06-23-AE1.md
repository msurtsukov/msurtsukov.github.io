While diving into Deep Learning, the topic of auto-encoders caught me, especially in terms of generating new objects. In an effort to improve the quality of generation, I read various blogs and literature on the topic of generative approaches. As a result, I decided to reflect the gained experience in a small series of articles, in which I tried briefly and with examples to describe all those problem areas I had encountered myself, while at the same time introducing to Keras.
