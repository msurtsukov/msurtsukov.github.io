My alma mater is the **Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology** (*MIPT*) - one of the top technical universities in Russia. I entered there for Physics Major, but switched to **CS** in process, where, by the way, were still quite a few physical courses. I chose **Robotics** as a laboratory. With this lab, I went to international robotics competitions *RoboChallenge* in Vienna, Austria to participate in the discipline *AirRace*, where one had to program a multikopter to fly over the traced path with time trial. Our solution was implemented in *ROS* and *OpenCV*, we took 4th place. On the 3rd and 4th years I got interested in **Machine Learning**, took several courses and specializations separately from the university. At the same time on the 4th year I studied finance and passed **CFA Level 1**.


After the university I became very fond of **Deep Learning** and studied it myself. Worked in the *DeepHack* lab at *MIPT* on several *NLP* projects. At the same time I became interested in models with *latent variables*, *Bayesian Deep Learning*. Participated in *Deep Bayes Summer School*, thoroughly studied *Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning* with exercises, consolidating knowledge through courses and specializations.


With my friend, was one of the founders of a startup which was involved in applying *ML* in the **Oil&Gas** Industry. In particular, we applied *Deep Learning* to the task of predicting the *Bottom Hole Pressure* in a hydraulic fracturing well. This yielded quality of the prediction far ahead of the currently used methods. Among other things we used *Bayesian Neural Networks* as a measure of the confidence of the model, which also bore fruit.


My hobbies include mountain biking, snowboarding, mountaineering.
